# Tutorial-For-Very-Simple-Resolver
This is a tutorial on how to create a simple resolver for the cheat Legendware. 



Step 1:
Learn basic CPP, there are many sites for this such as learnCPP.


Step 2:  
Go into a lobby, doesnt matter what and type in console "cl_showpos 1" 
Then get the speed for running, standing, micromovements, slowwalk whatever it is and note down those speeds.

Step 3: 
Have a side detect, this code is not paste ready and has some antipaste in it, so use your brain to fix it.

Step 4: 
Max moving value is 29.f
Most people use extended when standing so shoot 58 first
Most people use Low delta when slowwalking so shoot that first

Step 5: 
if (standing) {
